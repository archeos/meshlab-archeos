Source: http://sourceforge.net/projects/meshlab/files/meshlab/MeshLab%20v1.3.0/MeshLabSrc_AllInc_v130a.tgz
 The upstream Meshlab source has been repackaged for this Debian release.
 The primary reason is the uncertain copyright status of some (unused) code
 in the Meshlab distribution. Additionally, some external libraries which are
 distributed with the Meshlab source, but are also available in Debian as
 separate packages have been removed.
 .
 The following subdirectories or files have been removed:
 .
 meshlab/src/distrib/render_template    Unnecessary copies of MOSAICfunctions.h
 meshlab/src/distrib/sample             Textures with unknown copyright status.
